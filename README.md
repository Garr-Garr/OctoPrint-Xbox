# OctoPrint-Xbox

A plugin to control the 3D printer with an Xbox 360 wireless controller. An Xbox 360 USB receiver is required in order for this plugin to do anything. And of course, you would need a working Xbox controller.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

**TODO:** Describe how to install your plugin, if more needs to be done than just installing it via pip or through
the plugin manager.

## Configuration

Like usual for an Xbox controller, you will need to pair your controller with the newly-connected USB receiver. If it is successfully paired, one of the four LED segments should remain lit on the Xbox controller's Guide button in the middle.
